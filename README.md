# Hello-World
Learning to create a repository

My name is Dan. 
I am committed to immersing myself into the world 
of software engineering at all costs. 

My specific initial goal is front end web development. 
I have so much to learn.


LANGUAGES TO LEARN
HTML (NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE)
CSS (ALSO NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE)
JAVASCRIPT
